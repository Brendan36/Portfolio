Beef

Producing 1 kilogram of beef requires significantly more resources than producing chicken meat due to differences in animal biology, growth rates, and feed conversion efficiency.
Key Metrics for Beef Production:
Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR):
Beef cattle have an FCR of around 6–10, meaning it takes 6–10 kg of feed to produce 1 kg of live weight gain.
However, only about 60% of the live weight is converted to consumable meat, so the effective FCR for meat production is higher.

Water Requirement:
It takes about 15,000 liters of water (on average) to produce 1 kg of beef, including water for growing feed crops, drinking water, and processing.

Feed Breakdown:
Cattle are typically fed a combination of forage (grass, hay, silage) and grain (corn, soy, etc.) depending on the production system.
For grain-fed cattle, grain requirements dominate the feed input.
Approximate Feed Calculation:

Average Feed Requirement:
Let's assume 8 kg of feed per 1 kg of live weight gain for a typical beef cattle.
Since only 60% of live weight translates to edible meat, the adjusted FCR is approximately:
8kg feed / 0.6 (meat yield factor) = 13.33kg feed for 1kg beef.

Feed Types:
About 70–90% of this feed is forage (grass, silage).
The rest is grain or concentrate, which is more resource-intensive.

Final Estimate:
To produce 1 kg of beef:
1- 13–15 kg of feed (forage + grain) is required.
2- 15,000 liters of water (for feed production, drinking water, and processing).
* Land area and time for cattle to reach slaughter weight also contribute significantly.
! Beef production is more resource-intensive than chicken, making it a focus of sustainability discussions.
